# Swiss Cutlery Set
*Workshop project at CIM-UPC (Barcelona) - November 2023*

In collaboration with: Marina Dom√®nech, Josep Plandiura i Zeus Romanillos

## Description
This is a concept design of a cutlery set based on a traditional Swiss pocketknife, thought to bring the cutlery all-in-one place.

In addition, it was made as a final project of a 3d printing workshop for experimenting, testing and learning about this technology (FFF).
